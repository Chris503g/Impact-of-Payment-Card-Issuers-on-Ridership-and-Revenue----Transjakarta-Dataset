## Introduction

In this project, we analyze data from Transjakarta's public transportation system to gain insights into ridership, revenue, and the impact of payment card issuers. The dataset provides valuable information about payment card usage, demographics, and transaction details.

## Analysis Overview

We perform various analyses to explore the dataset and answer important questions related to ridership and revenue. Here's a brief overview of the analyses conducted:

## Analysis Details

### 1. Payment Card Issuer Distribution

We analyze the distribution of payment card issuers to understand which issuers are most commonly used for Transjakarta transactions. Insights from this analysis help us identify dominant issuers.

### 2. Average Fare per Ride for Each Card Issuer

We calculate the average fare per ride for each card issuer. This analysis reveals whether specific issuers lead to higher or lower fares and their impact on revenue.

### 3. Total Revenue by Payment Card Issuer

We determine the total revenue generated by each payment card issuer and visualize it in descending order. This analysis helps us identify which issuers contribute the most to revenue.

### 4. Customer Gender Distribution

We explore the distribution of customers by gender using visualizations like pie charts or bar charts. This analysis provides insights into the gender demographics of Transjakarta riders.

### 5. Total Revenue by Demographic

We analyze total revenue by demographic factors such as gender. This analysis assesses whether certain demographics influence spending behavior and revenue.

### 6. Pay Amount Distribution

We visualize the distribution of pay amounts to identify any outliers or patterns in payment values.

### 7. Bank Issuer Distribution by Gender

We examine the distribution of payment card issuers by gender, providing insights into gender preferences for different issuers.

### 8. ANOVA Test

We perform an ANOVA test to determine if there are statistically significant differences in pay amounts among different payment card issuers. The results help us understand the impact of issuers on payment amounts.
